# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

I've just landed a job as a data analyst for Pyber, a Python based ride sharing application company. My first assignment was perform an exploratory analysis on data in some very large .csv files. To aid this process, I created several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. I then wrote Python scripts using Pandas libraries that Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, rider, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualization I produced helped Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

I just completed my first big project at Pyber: analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. Even before starting at PyBer, I heard stories about V. Isualize. She is a former programmer who started out at MathWorks, a co-founder of PyBer, and is known for being extremely fair yet extremely demanding. Because of her programming expertise, she's particularly insistent that the analytical work be comprehensive and correct. My manager, Omar, is excited for my big break V. Isualize has given Omar and I a brand-new assignment. 

Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I will submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Results

## Summary

The three business recommendations for the CEO to address disparities among the city types are: 
1. In rural areas, where population is much lower, ensuring marketing/promotional efforts are consistently populated throughout towns would be good to overrun the market and smaller ride companies (i.e. local taxis) in that area.
2. In the suburban and urban areas, where population is much higher and more access to city amenities, it may be worth while to look into levels of service that can be offered to riders (i.e. plus, premium, etc), which may possibly boost the average fare per ride and per driver up a bit. 
3. In all areas, it would be beneficial to have data on the percentage of fare the rider makes versus the company so that we can see if there is any room to add more drivers specifically for the rural and suburban areas and hopefully boost that revenue up.
